Grades in this class will be assigned based on a weighted average of your
performance in these categories:

* 20%	Final Exam
* 20%	Quizzes	
* 20%	Participation
* 20%	Paper1 
* 20%	Paper2


The final exam will be comprehensive.

Homework will always be due in class, neatly handwritten or typed, unless
otherwise specified in a particular assignment.  Late work will not be
accepted.

Quizzes will be at the *start* of each class session, and, if missed, they
cannot be made up.

Your participation grade will include your contributions to the class and to
your groups during class time.
